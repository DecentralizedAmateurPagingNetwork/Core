# DAPNET CORE #
# At the moment, there is no need for new instations of DAPNET Cores of this version. A second one is under development. So please wait. #

## Introduction ##
The DAPNET CORE offers the main functionality of the Decentralized Amateur Paging Network.
It builds up a cluster together with other DAPNET Core instances over the HAMNET and
controls connected paging transmitter. All functions can be accessed via the REST API.

## Installation and Requirements ##
Using the packed release version no installation is required. All external libraries are
included. Just make sure a JAVA 8+ runtime environment is available.


## Usage ##
### Basic Configuration ###
#### Cluster Configuration ####
If you would like to join an existing cluster contact an admin. He will register your
DAPNET Core instance and inform you about the configuration. If you want to create a new
cluster feel free to set your own configuration. In each case set the following parameters
in the `local/config/ClusterConfig.xml` and `local/config/Settings.json` :

* Node name (name of your DAPNET Core instance) and cluster name (name of the DAPNET Cluster) at Settings.json
  ```
  ...
  "clusterSettings": {
      ...
      "nodeName": "THIS_IS_YOUR_CALLSIGN_AS_ITS_IN_SETUP_IN_THE_CLUSTER",
      "channelName": "DAPNET"
  },
  ...
  
* Node authentication key (needed for authentication if you want to rejoin your cluster
  later) of form XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX (X is alphanumeric) at ClusterConfig.xml \
  `<AUTH auth_value="key"/>`
* Initial hosts (if you want to join an existing cluster at least one node have to be
  known... ) at ClusterConfig.xml \
  `<TCPPING initial_hosts="HostA[7800],HostB[7800]\>`

#### Log Settings ####
The DAPNET Core uses Log4j2 for logging, which can be configured in the
`config/LogSettings.xml`. The default setting will inform you about nearly all events in
the console and additionally will store all logs in a file.

#### General Settings ####
In the `Setting.json` file various parameters can be set. The default settings should fit
for most use cases. However, important could be the `"port": 8080"` line to configure the
port of the REST API.

### First Start ###
1. Make sure you performed the basic configuration as described above.
2. Start the application with `java -Dlog4j.configurationFile=../local/config/LogSettings_REST.xml -jar dapnet-core-x.x.x.jar`
3. In case you connect to an existing cluster all current data will be automatically
   downloaded. If you create a new cluster and no `date/state.json` is found the
   parameters of your node will be set to default values. Additionally, a default user
   `admin` with password `admin` will be automatically created, which you can used to
   connect with the REST interface.
4. After a successful startup you can start to play with the REST API
   ([API Description](https://bitbucket.org/DAPNET/dapnet-core/wiki/Beschreibung%20der%20REST%20API))
5. In case you created a new cluster please set all parameters of your node (e.g.
   longitude and latitude), set the `admin` user's mail address and especially set a new
   password.
